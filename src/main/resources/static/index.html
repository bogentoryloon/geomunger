This application attempts to determine individual locations within
a given driving distance of a central point (it uses Irish GPs because that was a data set I had handy).<br>The step is to load the data<br>After that, the data can be reduced in size, the geo-coded via the google maps API (warning, it's only free key, so currently restricted to 2,500/day).<br>There after the intent was to use this data set to find efficient methods of selectively invoking a driving distance API (in this Bing, because I didn't read the google direction API license till too late)
