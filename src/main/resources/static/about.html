<h3>The Idea</h3>
The Datalex programming task is pretty open-ended i.e. no spec. Danger! Danger!<br>So try and think of something realistic and quantifiable. Data extraction and mangling is my forte, so what to do?<br>I had the brainwave to use GCD approximation assuming Ireland was on the equator, then refining to see how much fudge factor was 

neccessary.

<br>The germ of plan - if it goes no further I might have something usable in the day job - there was something along the lines of h finding GPs doing long distance house calls above the norm. <br>Or was it to recommend GPs ranked 

by google journey time?<br>Whatever - instead of doing a call to google journey time for every GP in the land, if their stored geocode were available, and 

thus their long and lat we could do targetted sql extraction based on GCDin ever increasing sizes till we hit a threshold of x 

GPs y miles drive away (the alternative, we do this for c.2M medical card holder and c.2k GPs represents 4Bn google hits/data 

rows. Without my data scientist/accountant hat on I'm going to assume this is untenable).
<br>So the objective now is to capture the N closest, ordered, GPs for each known individual.
<h3>The Plan</h3>
locate semi realistic set of addresses for Gps (or surrogate)
<br>locate semi realistic set of addresses for patient (or surrogate)
<br>geocode both
<br>develop GCD approximation to locate nearest N GPs per patient
<br>test against driving distance API<br>refine fudge factor to minimise google calls
<br>present the results in some fashion
