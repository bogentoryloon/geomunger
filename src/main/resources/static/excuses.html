This was probably over ambitious considering how little coding I do this days, but you have to try.
<br>The actual web screens, which weren't supposed to be the focus (as you can tell), took surprisingly long - very rusty on that.
The google maps api was a breeze, then I discovered they strongly for 
forbid any usage offline. <br>Oh well, googles loss, MS gain. Except that was yet more new ground to break - had to parse some meaty json.<br>At this stage I was jetisonning stuff left and right  - fancy graphics for the end result was long gone.<br>An embedded,  shippable database was abandonned as yet another thing that would take too long   (hence the bizarrely old fashionned reading and writing to files).</body>
